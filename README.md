# server-client_Qt_Application
Server and Client communication GUI application made using Qt.

To start, open Qt. select the following:

new > new file or project > base class: QDialog > project name: Client

Repeat that step for the server as well.

The dialog.ui files contain the front-end code, while the source files contain the backend development. Note the subtle but key changes in the .pro files. These are essential to enabling networking.
